## Simple Configuration Example:

    apple_trailers:
      quality: 480p
      genres: [[and Adventure'|'Action]]
    accept_all: yes
    download: ~/movies/trailers


This would download all trailers in the Action and Adventure genre in 480p resolution. `quality` can be 480p or 720p. `genres` is a comma-separated list of genres to include from the list on [[Apple's website|http://trailers.apple.com/#section=genres]]. If a trailer is not listed in a particular genre, it will not be downloaded.
