## Per series settings

When specifying a setting for a series, you must add a colon to the end of the series name, and add 4 more spaces before the setting name:


    series:
      - series name:
          [[[value|setting]:]]


For example, with [[quality|Plugins/series/quality]] settings:


    series:
      - Series 1
      - Series 2:
          quality: hdtv
      - Series 3:
          quality: 720p
