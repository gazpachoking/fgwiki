## Quality

||**Name*'||'*Description**||
||quality||Accept only qualities that match this quality requirement. No other quality will be accepted.||
||qualities||Accept all given qualities, multiple downloads||

Values should all be specified as a valid [[quality requirement|Qualities#Requirements]] string.
**Example:**


    series:
      - name of series 1:
          quality: 720p+
      - name of series 2:
          qualities:
            - pdtv !h264
            - 720p hdtv|webdl


Usually best way to specify quality for series is to use groups:
**Example:**


    series:
      720p:
        - name of series 1
        - name of series 2
      hdtv:
        - name of series 3
        - name of series 4


See [[groups|Plugins/series/per_group_settings]] for more information.
