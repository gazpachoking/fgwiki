# Advanced exec
**As of r1552 adv_exec has become [[exec plugin advanced configuration|Plugins/exec#[[AdvancedConfiguration]]]].**

Execute commands.
**Format:**


    adv_exec:
      [[        [event|ON_EVENT]:]]: CMD
        [FOR_ENTRIES]: CMD


Available *ON_EVENTS*: on_start, on_input, on_filter, on_output and on_exit
(XXX macro: "BR")
Available *FOR_ENTRIES*: for_entries, for_accepted and for_rejected
(XXX macro: "BR")
(XXX macro: "BR")
    
**Example:**


    adv_exec: 
      on_start: 
        event: echo "Started"
      on_input:
        for_entries: echo 'got %(title)s'
      on_output: 
        for_accepted: echo 'accepted %(title)s - %(url)s' > file

    
You can use all (available) entry fields in the command. If you would like an entry to fail if entry field is not available, you can set the fail_entries option to yes, like this:


    adv_exec:
      fail_entries: yes
      on_output: 
        for_accepted: echo 'accepted %(title)s - %(url)s' > file


Setting the fail_entries option to yes will also cause the entry to fail if the executed command has a non-zero return code.
