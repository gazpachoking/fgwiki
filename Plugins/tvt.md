# TVTorrents
**Plugin seems to be broken at the moment and there's nobody to maintain it**
(XXX macro: "BR")(XXX macro: "BR")(XXX macro: "BR")

A customized HTML input module. Parses out full torrent URLs from [[TVTorrents|http://tvtorrents.com]]' page for recently aired TV show episodes.

May break in the future, as it depends on the exact structure of the HTML.

Plugin-specific code by Fredrik Bränström.

## Usage

Just set **tvt: yes** and configure [[cookies|Plugins/cookies]] plugin.

## Example
