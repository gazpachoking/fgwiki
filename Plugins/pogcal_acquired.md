# Pogcal Acquired
This plugin marks the checkbox for accepted episodes on the [[pogdesign TV calendar|http://pogdesign.co.uk/cat]].
**Notes:**
- This will only work for episodes that aired during the same month you download them.
- The release numbering must match up with the numbering on pogdesign for it to work. (Date and sequence type shows will not work.)
- The show name normalization probably needs some improvement to match the names on the tv calendar. Feel free to [[report an issue|http://flexget.com/newticket]] for shows that are not working.

### Configuration
This plugin takes just two options, your username and password at the pogdesign calendar.
