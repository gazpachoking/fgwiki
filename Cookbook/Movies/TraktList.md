# Fill movie_queue from trakt.tv or IMDb watchlist

This task will add movies from [[trakt.tv] and/or [http://imdb.com IMDb] watchlists to your [wiki:Plugins/movie_queue movie_queue]. This is not intended to download anything, just fill the FlexGet movie queue from there. You will have to have another task with the [wiki:Plugins/movie_queue movie_queue] plugin to do the actual downloading. You can remove either the [wiki:Plugins/imdb_list imdb_list] or [wiki:Plugins/trakt_list trakt_list|http://trakt.tv]] plugin from this recipe if you do not want to use that particular site.
